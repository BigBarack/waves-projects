the answer to the first question is that the boundary on gamma 0 is an essential  boundary conditionif you want the term to vanish at the boundary. since the variation is between the path of the two points and not at the points self
since the normal gradient term doesnt vanish at the boundary of gamma 1 so

The second boundary counts as a natural boundary because it only affects th derivative of the function values we take in account for the absorping layer in gamma 2 whit

Describing the function space: Since we are working with the weak formulation we would want them to be in the sobolev space
Let's now think if we want to go  to specific sobolev spaces if there are in the weak formulation we would prefer that the directional derivative is alo
square integrable
