the answer to the first question is that the boundary on gamma 0 is an essential  boundary conditionif you want the term to vanish at the boundary. since the variation is between the path of the two points and not at the points self
since the normal gradient term doesnt vanish at the boundary of gamma 1 so

The same can be told for the second boundary since an exponential with an imaginary argument is not absorbative then it cant reduce to zero
